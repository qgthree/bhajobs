# BHA Jobs Website

BHA’s Strategic Communications Division Chief noticed that the BHA Jobs website was in desperate need of a redesign. Initially, she simply asked me to work with a designer to mockup a new look, since the project belonged to another team that lacked design expertise. The result was so simple and clean, I was tempted to build it out anyway.

From the designer’s mockup, I constructed a responsive frontend and handed the assets off to the .net developer, who only needed a few meetings to integrate the backend. This was such a simple and easy project, it was a delight to work on, and it didn’t hurt that it produced a great deal of praise for everyone involved.
